=head1 SUPPORT

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-dist-zilla-plugin-consistentversiontest@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web
interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>. I will be notified, and then you'll
automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

=head1 DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that B<I am not suggesting that you must do this> in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time, which seems unlikely at best.

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
button on this page: L<http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html>
