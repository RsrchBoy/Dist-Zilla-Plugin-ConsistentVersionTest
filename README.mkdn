# DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me (the author, Dave Rolsky) for the work I've done on
this module, please consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a
lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support
you'd care to offer.

Please note that **I am not suggesting that you must do this** in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time, which seems unlikely at best.

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
button on this page: [http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html](http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html)

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
